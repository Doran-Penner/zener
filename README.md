# Zener (WIP)
Playable implementation of the board game
[Zener](https://en.boardgamearena.com/tutorial?game=zener&tutorial=817),
make for Paideia 2025.

## How to use

The code is all in the `src/` directory. The core gameplay, including move
validation, checking who wins, and so on is stored in `core.py`. To actually
play the game, run the (upcoming) file `python3 tui.py` to play a simple game
loop in the terminal with user input, and in the future there will be a visual
interface as well. There are no dependencies (except for python3); you should
just be able to clone this repository (or copy the files directly) and run it.

## Contributing

This is a small project and surely has bugs. Any/all contributions are welcome!
