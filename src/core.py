"""
We store state by player, then piece, then position & other data.
The piece is an object, everything else is a dict.
Here's an example of our database schema:
{
    "white": {
        "circle": Piece("circle", 0, 0, 0),
        "plus": Piece("plus", 1, 0, 0),
        ...
    },
    "black": ...,
}
(0, 0) is the lower left corner from white's perspective;
x values should be in [0, 4] and y values should be in [0, 6] (unless winning).

To get information about the game, use `get_full_board` to get the positions
of every piece on the board (as specified above), and `get_valid_moves`
to get all valid next moves. The move schema for a move to position (x, y) is
(player, shape, x, y), just a tuple of all the necessary information.

The way to make moves is with the `try_move` operation. The input schema is the
same as the above move schema, so if a strategy always chooses from the list of
`get_valid_moves` then it will always give an valid move request.
This gives a response as (response, extra_info).
`response` will always be one of
["move_failure", "move_success", "win_white", "win_black", "already_over"];
`extra_info` will be any extra information for human consumption.
Note that the turn tracker will silently move onto a player's second move if they
cannot make their first move, and if a player is unable to move at all then the
game will end without asking for input from the losing player - it will just
send a victory response to the last caller and then lock up.

Once the game is over, the core will lock up and not accept any more `try_move`s
(though it will still give information with `get` methods). At any time after
game end the `get_who_won()` method wll return the winner of the game, either
"black" or "white" (and that information will also be given on the winning move).
